## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Frontend**: React Native Expo with TypeScript
2. **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL + Storage)
3. **Navigation**: React Navigation v7
4. **State Management**: React Context (AuthContext)
5. **Styling**: StyleSheet (native)
6. **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 (planned)

## 📝 Important Notes

- Database password stored in `.env.local` (not committed)
- Using email confirmation for sign-ups
- RLS policies protect user data
- Offline-first architecture planned
- Anonymous mood sharing in circles

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Press 'w' for web
# Or scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

## 📁 Key Files

- `.env.local` - Supabase credentials
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Auth state management
- `src/screens/` - All app screens
- `database/` - SQL schemas

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

1. **Entry point error**: Fixed by renaming index.ts → index.js
